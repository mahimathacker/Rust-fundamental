//Memory- stack and heap
//Stack - Store the data fixed size,known at compile time,fast access,last in first out ,LIFO

//Heap - Store the data variable size,unknown at compile time,slow access,FIFO
//Data is slower access than stack
//Memory safety is enforced through rust's ownership and borrowing rules
//Stack datat type: i32,bool,char,tuple,array
//Heap datat type: String,Vec<T>,Hashmap<K,V>
