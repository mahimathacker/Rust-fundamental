    /* The problem: s1 is trying to reference s, but s has been moved and no longer exists. This creates a dangling reference - s1 is pointing to memory that has been freed.
Why this violates Rust's borrowing rules:
References must always point to valid data
A reference cannot outlive the data it's referencing
When s was moved to s2, the original s ceased to exist
s1 is now referencing invalid memory


= (move): Transfers ownership, invalidates the original
=& (borrow): Creates a reference, leaves ownership unchanged
Think of it like this:
Move: "I give you my car" â†’ I no longer have a car
Borrow: "You can use my car" â†’ I still have my car, you just have permission to use it

//We can create multiple immutable references, but only one mutable reference
